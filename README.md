# TextBasedGame_OOP
This project was developed based on a given assignment. 
The aim of the project is to create a Java-based object-oriented programming (OOP) game with a turn and text-based interface. 
The objective is to understand and use the features of OOP and comprehend the relationships between them.

### List of the Requested Items
    Items
    In the game, there are two types of items. One is weapons that determine the given damage, and the other is armor 
    that reduces damage.

    Characters
    There are three characters in the game: fighter, tank, and healer, in that order. The fighter is attack-oriented, 
    the tank is defense-oriented, and the healer is support-oriented. Each character has a carrying capacity for items. 
    This capacity and the characters' health are determined by their strength, vitality, and intelligence values.

    Gameplay
    As mentioned earlier, the game is turn-based. The player starts the game, and then it switches to the enemy's turn. 
    When all the enemies in the player's current area are defeated, the game automatically progresses to the next area. 
    The player tries to reach the highest level possible by giving commands to their characters and progressing as far 
    as they can.
